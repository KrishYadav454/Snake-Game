## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic arcade-style game has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Control the snake, eat the food, grow longer, and try to achieve the highest score possible without hitting the walls or yourself.

## Features

- Responsive game board that adapts to different screen sizes
- Real-time score tracking
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows
- Game over popup with restart option
- Smooth snake movement and growth animation

## How to Play

1. Open `snake.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the snake's direction.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the board.
4. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and your score increases.
5. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
6. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
7. After game over, you can choose to restart or return to the home page.
